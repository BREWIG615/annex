# Annex A

The purpose of this repository is to create a repeatable process and layout that is visually appealing for our academic paper.

## Use

The `gen_annex.py` will allow the user to generate a structured annex that can scale with changes while maintaining a standard formatting.

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python gen_annex.py
pdflatex annex.tex
```

## Update

This is not beautiful, but is enough to demonstrate functionality.
